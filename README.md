## Description of Files

### Table S1: Collected Sample Data
The table consists of sample names, GPS coordinates, and the analytical methods carried out on each sample.

### Table S2: U-Pb Zircon LA-ICP-MS Data
The table consists of zircon U-Pb and trace element data from samples analyzed by LA-ICP-MS at Boise State University

### Table S3: U-Pb Zircon CA-ID-TIMS Data
The table consists of zircon U-Pb data from samples analyzed by CA-ID-TIMS at Boise State University.

### Table S4: U-Pb Calcite LA-ICP-MS Data
The table consists of vein calcite U-Pb data from samples analyzed by LA-ICP-MS at UC Santa Barbara.

### Table S5: δ13C, δ18O, and ∆47 Isotope Analyses
The table consists of carbon and oxygen isotope data obtained from samples of vein calcite at UC Berkeley and Brown University and oxygen isotope data obtained from samples of vein quartz at Brown University.

### Additional Table 1: Bayfield Group Pebble Count Data
The table consists of Bayfield Group pebble count data from two measured sections proximal to the Douglas Fault. The data are plotted in Figure 5 of the manuscript.

### Additional Table 2: Plot Digitized Vein Calcite Stable Isotope Data
The table consists of plot digitized vein calcite stable isotope data extracted from four plots in Figure 6.9 of Mauk et al. (1992) for which no data table was available. The plot digitized data were then plotted in Figure 9 of the manuscript.
